    "## INTRODUCTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **good package tracking system** is essential due to the growing demand for **efficient delivery services**.\n",
    "2. **Traditional methods** struggle with tracking **shipment history** and **prioritizing deliveries**.\n",
    "3. **Linked lists** allow shipment records to be **stored and accessed easily**.\n",
    "4. **Priority queues** help in **scheduling deliveries** based on **urgency**.\n",
    "5. **Real-time tracking** enhances **shipment visibility**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a **smart system** to improve **logistics operations**."

    "# PRIORITY QUEUE \n",
    "\n",
    "## Priority Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "A Priority Queue is a special type of queue where each element has a priority assigned to it. Instead of following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule like a normal queue, elements with higher priority are processed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of a Priority Queue:\n",
    "1) **Elements have priorities** – Each item in the queue is assigned a priority.\n",
    "2) **Higher priority elements are served first** – If two elements have the same priority, they follow FIFO order.\n",
    "3) **Efficient scheduling** – Used in CPU scheduling, networking, and logistics management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Methods:\n",
    "- **Using a Binary Heap** (Most common, O(logn) operations)\n",
    "- **Using a Sorted List** (Fast removal but slow insertion)\n",
    "- **Using a Self-Balancing BST** (Efficient for dynamic operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## LINKED LIST\n",
    "\n",
    "A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are connected using pointers. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of a Linked List:\n",
    "1) **Dynamic Size** – Can grow or shrink easily without memory wastage.\n",
    "2) **Efficient Insertions & Deletions** – Adding/removing elements is faster than arrays (no shifting required).\n",
    "3) **Uses Pointers** – Each node stores data and a pointer to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Linked Lists:\n",
    "- **Singly Linked List** – Each node points to the next node only.\n",
    "- **Doubly Linked List** – Each node points to both the previous and next nodes.\n",
    "- **Circular Linked List** – The last node connects back to the first node.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "# Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Efficient Package Management* – Store and track package details effectively.  \n",
    "2. *Shipment History Tracking* – Maintain a log of package status updates.  \n",
    "3. *Priority-Based Delivery* – Ensure high-priority packages are delivered first.  \n",
    "4. *Real-Time Package Status* – Allow users to check package delivery status anytime.  \n",
    "5. *Simple & Scalable Design* – Easy to understand and extend in the future.\n"
